This is my simple music player website, which fetches songs from the local folder and make your songs play, pause, previous and next. Also it has a volume rocker and mute buttom and a seekbar and timer for showing the length of your music. To use this on your laptop, download the zip file in your laptop and open it with vs code. 
I added only one song in each folder, but you can copy your favorite songs to the songs folder, and you will able to listen your own songs in your browser.
It is responsive for laptop and mobiles but soon i will make it responsive for all types of devices.
Remember to extract the zip file before open it, otherwise it will not open.
